# Get rank position provided by Alexa.com

This is a simple python script that scrape information about a given domain name (input URL) from Alexa.com website. For example you can run a test about the rank of google.com with the command:

"python alexa_get_rank.py google.com" 

It will probably return:

"google.com;1449576825.79;1;1;0"

The columns means the following:
1st) the tested_URL; 
2nd) the timestamp; 
3rd) the actual rank; 
4th) a reached rank; and 
5th) the rank delta.
